Unveil Your Best represents a sophisticated Shopify e-commerce platform that showcases the power of custom Liquid templating and modern e-commerce best practices. This project demonstrates advanced Shopify development techniques, from custom theme creation to performance optimization.

## Technical Implementation

### Custom Liquid Development
The project leverages Shopify's Liquid templating language to create dynamic, data-driven experiences:

{% assign filtered_products = collections.all.products %}

{% if collection.filters.size > 0 %}
  {% for filter in collection.filters %}
    {% case filter.type %}
      {% when 'price_range' %}
        {% assign filtered_products = filtered_products | where: 'price', '>=', filter.min_value.value %}
        {% assign filtered_products = filtered_products | where: 'price', '<=', filter.max_value.value %}
      {% when 'list' %}
        {% assign filtered_products = filtered_products | where: filter.param_name, filter.active_values %}
    {% endcase %}
  {% endfor %}
